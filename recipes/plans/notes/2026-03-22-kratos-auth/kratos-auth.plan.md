# Kratos auth flows — Implementation plan

This plan follows [kratos-auth.spec.md](./kratos-auth.spec.md). Run workflows from **recipes/plans**.

**Principles:** Kratos pages live in **`hub/clients/auth/`** only (no `saflib/identity/auth` for this project). **Recipes** is the first app to integrate (shared hub auth client). **Remove hub identity** from hub + recipes monoliths as part of scope. **Do not change** `kratos-courier`. Add **recovery** to **all three** `kratos.yml` files (`recipes/dev`, `deploy/kratos-prod-local`, `deploy/remote-assets`).

---

## Milestone 0 — SDK + Kratos config groundwork

**Packages:** `recipes/service/sdk`, the three `kratos.yml` files above.

**Goal:** SDK helpers for flows you will need next (at minimum registration + session). Enable **recovery** blocks + `ui_url` in all three configs; confirm **verification** `ui_url` and `use: code` match `hub/clients/auth` routes.

**Stopping point:** Dev Kratos reflects config; SDK can create/update registration flow from the app.

---

## Milestone 1 — Registration (first vertical slice)

**Packages:** `hub/clients/auth`, `recipes/clients/...`, SDK as needed.

**Goal:** Single Kratos **registration** flow end-to-end: user registers, ends **logged in**, redirects to **recipes app**. Wire routes only for this slice (no full auth matrix yet).

**Stopping point:** Manual test on dev: register → lands in recipes with session.

---

## Milestone 2 — Login

**Packages:** `hub/clients/auth`, recipes wiring.

**Goal:** **Login** flow; successful login redirects into recipes per product rules.

**Stopping point:** Register (existing) + login both work; session shared as expected.

---

## Milestone 3 — Verification + verify wall

**Packages:** `hub/clients/auth`, recipes (gating).

**Goal:** **Verification** (code method). If the user is logged in but email is not verified, show **verify wall** (reuse or add page) instead of the main app—do not redirect straight into the app until policy is satisfied.

**Stopping point:** Unverified user sees wall; after verification, can use recipes normally.

---

## Milestone 4 — Recovery

**Packages:** `hub/clients/auth`, SDK (recovery helpers if not already), all three `kratos.yml` recovery entries verified against routes.

**Goal:** Forgot password → email → complete reset → can log in again.

**Stopping point:** Full recovery path works in dev.

---

## Milestone 5 — Remove hub identity from hub + recipes

**Packages:** `hub/service/monolith`, `recipes/service/monolith`, `package.json` deps, deploy env / Caddy / docker as needed.

**Goal:** No `startHubIdentityService()` (and no `@sderickson/hub-identity` dependency) on these monoliths; env vars and proxies no longer assume identity gRPC service for this stack.

**Stopping point:** Hub and recipes monoliths start without identity service; auth works via Kratos only.

---

## Milestone 6 — Tests and polish

**Goal:** Playwright or integration tests where the repo mocks email; remove or retire prototype-only pages (e.g. Kratos test page) if redundant; i18n/accessibility as needed.

**Stopping point:** CI green; spec acceptance criteria met.
